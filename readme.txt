Allows you to restrict registration for custom usernames, email addresses and custom email service providers

== Description ==

Restrict User Registration Plugin allows you to restrict registration for custom usernames, email addresses and custom email service providers.

<h3>Features:</h3>

<li><strong>Restrict specific usernames:</strong>Allows you to easily add custom usernames in the dashboard options panel ( users > restrict registration ). Once you set up these custom usernames, each time someone tries to register to your WordPress blog/site providing this targeted username, the registration process is getting bailed and the user gets an error message.</li>

<li><strong>Restrict specific emails:</strong>You can add specific email addresses ( example me@example.com) and they will be automatically ignored and rejected from user registration process.</li>

<li><strong>Restrict emails from specific domain:</strong> This one can also be an anti-spam tool. Before digging into details about this one, an email service provider is the website (domain name) that follows @ in the email address. An example is gmail.com from Google, you can add these service providers domains and they will be ignored and restricted as well. An example is adding outlook.com to ignore all registrations using an email address ending in @outlook.com ( that's a secure one by the way, from Microsoft.)</strong>

<li><strong>Custom error messages:</strong>You can set up custom error messages so that the users trying to register and getting bailed will then know what the issue is and what to do for better experience.<li>
